# Car Dashboard
# By: Jencie Daniel

## The Current Dashboard
There are a number of different dashboard designs that are unique to each vehicle model. Dashboards have changed over the years, becoming more modern as each new vehicle comes into the market. For example, the way cars dashboards were designed when cars were just becoming accessible were made with looks in mind. Style was the center of design with a number of gauges and knobs to draw attention. As the functionalities and features in cars became more expansive, dashboards are nowadays moving towards the digial side with touchscreen features.

## Common Features
There are a few common features that are included in most car dashboards, and some of the features can be considered to be pros while others can be cons, these include:
## Pros:
### 1. Circular Speedometer
The speedometer displays the current speed of the vehicle. Typically there is a needle that points to the current speed and it pivots with one end that is stationary. As the individual accelerates or decelerates, the needle moves around the circular path. This is a pro because people can clearly view the speed and can regulate the amount of pressure one should apply to the acceleration in order to keep the speed constant.
 
### 2. Tachometer
The tachometer can help users understand and regulate the amount of power they are demanding from the car when they are driving. The tachometer displays how the vehicle is changing the gears when the RPM (rotations per minute) reach a certain point while driving. It is especially useful for manual vehicles because as the RPM goes up, shifting the gear can increase fuel efficiency and help increase the longevity of the engine.
 
### 3. Errors and Car Status Symbols
Most vehicle dashboards contain a number of symbols that indicate the status of the vehicle being driven. Generally, these symbols light up when there is a change in status for anything associated with the symbol. For example, when one of the tires reads a lot tire pressure, the tire pressure symbol lights up. Similarly, there are many indicators that relay information about the car.
  
## Cons
### 1. Limited Information Display
When people drive, there is a collaboration between the steering wheel dashboard as well as the center dashboard, but there are times when information that can be displayed on the steering dashboard are only available on the central dashboard. Something that should be able to be immediately accessed by the driver may include the tire pressure diplay that shows the pressure of all of the tires in the system.
  
### 2. Speed Display
Although the needle of the speedometer points to the current speed of the vehicle, it is a common preference to have a numerical display that tells the speed without having to follow where the needle is pointing. When the speed is displayed digitally, the driver will have easy visual of the current speed at which the vehicle is traveling.
  
### 3. Bright Dashboards
There are some vehicles that have very bright dashboards that introduce to many vibrant colors. This can be distracting and confusing for the person operating the vehicle due to all the bright symbols and the introduction of numerous colors, especially displays that contain colors that are considered to be warning colors such as yellow and red.

## Features:
### Common Features
 - Speedometer
 - Tachometer
 - Odometer
 - Engine Coolant Temperature Gauge
 - Fuel Gauge
 - Turn Indicators
 - Gearshift Position Indicator
 - Seat Belt Warning Light
 - Parking-Brake Warning Light
 - Engine-Malfunction Lights

### Rare Features
 - Navigation System in Steering Dashboard
 - Fully Digital Display
 - Heads-Up Display
 - Collision Warning
 - Blind Spot Monitoring
 - Coffee Break Indicator

## Controls:
1. Turn on the vehicle using the key or start button.
2. Proceed to step on the brake and shift the gear from park to reverse, drive, neutral, etc.
3. Begin driving. As the accelerator is pressed, the speed of the vehicle increases and the RPM aslo increases to give more power to the car as it is taking off.
4. One the tachometer goes up to a certain RPM, in order to increase efficiency, the car will shift gears and the RPM will come back down. The changes in the RPM is indicated by the tachometer display.
5. The user can adjust certain things such as the lights, gear, indicator, and other things by turning those features on and off or changing the setting.
6. The symbols such as the tire pressure indicator or the seatbelt indicator will light up in order to indicate those warnings.

## Common Mistakes
 - Not paying heed to warning signs that the dashboard indicates
 - Not checking the condition and pressures of the tires of the vehicle
 - Not checking their blind spot and surroundings before shifting lanes
 - Not paying attention to the road or focusing on other things

## My Design and Improvements

### Digital Display of Speed and RPM
 - The digital display will show the driver a clear visual of the speed at which they are traveling. Easy access to that data can help minimize distractions and help with speed regulation.

### Colorful Indicator of the Status of the Fuel and Coolant Temperature
 - I introduced colored gradient bars to give a clear indicator of the amount of fuel left. When the tank is full, it shows the entire bar, but as the fuel is used, the bar shows red. The same concept applies for the coolant temperature. As the engine heats up, the gradient will move towards the red side. This will be a clear indicator for low fuel or an overheating engine because the color red is considered to be an evident warning signal.

### Options for Vechicle Statistics on the Steering Dashboard
 - On the left side, there are options for viewing additional information in regards to the tires, trip, and navigation. This will make it easier for the driver to visualize the information they need and access it directly from the display in front of them rather than having to turn towards the center dashboard.
